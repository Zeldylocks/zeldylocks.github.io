				<p>
					I started playing League of Legends in December 2010 and quit in December 2018, which means I've seen the majority of the development twists and turns the game has undergone over the years. Many aspects of the game went through major overhauls, such as the map, the jungle, and nearly every single item and character individually, or as part of a bigger update. But one aspect would remain "unfinished" (in my opinion) to this day; the Item System.<br>
					Late 2020s, RIOT had an Item System Update, in which I took interest in even though I was no longer playing. It introduced new "Mythic" items for the late-game, revamped the Shop UI, and added a new recommendation system. As cool and broad as this update was, it unfortunately did not fix what I felt was broken; <em>how the items work</em>. The main grievance I have with their Item System, is the <em>"meta"</em> of which items are built. The items define how a champion is played, or the other way around, meaning when an item is tweaked, it has a domino effect, branching across other champions that commonly use that same item. And this cycle is hard to break when the majority of the champions are designed around certain existing items types, or as before, the other way around. My design attempts to shave off a large part of this item-champion codependency.</p>
					<h4>The Current Item System</h4>
					<p>
						<i>Players purchase items from the shop. The item is a modular enhancement. The player's inventory usually contains up to five main items, emphasizing selection importance. Most items can be improved. Improving an item increases its quality tier, which essentially are basic, epic, and legendary. Items above the basic tier have a recipe, a set of requirements that need to be met in order to aquire it. The recipe consists of a gold cost and a list of lower tier items. Epic tier items require basic items, and legendary tier items require epic and/or basic tier items. The higher the tier, the bigger the buff, which basically are stat buff, passive effect, aura, and active effect. In conclusion, as the game progresses, the players buy increasingly expensive items as dictated by the legendary item recipes, which in turn are dictated by the champion they are playing with. This is called "the meta".</i></p>
					<h4>The Issue</h4>
					<p>
						My issue is the recipe-specific item exclusivity. Champions usually have a narrow pool of legendary items that synergize with them the best, and most of the time they center around one or two main stats most champions have, such as armor, magic resistance, health, mana, ability power, and attack damage (plus a few others). The selection can vary a little depending on your opponents and personal playstyle, but usually there is no room for meta deviations. And didn't like that. If you bought a basic tier item, you seemingly had a wide selection of items it could be built into, but ultimately always built the same items because there was actually only a certain legendary items that you could viably build. Worst of all, some scenarios forced you to buy duplicates of the same legendary items because it was your best choice. No matter how cool benefits other items would give, you couldn't build them because they would provide the <em>wrong basic stats</em>, so you ended up always building the same items.<br>
					<b>Example.</b> If you played with Rammus, you would build as much armor and health as possible. Armor, because Rammus has a passive ability that synergizes with it, and health, because Rammus is a tank. So, you open your item shop, select to view every item that gives health and armor, and then buying the ones that gave those stats the most as the game progressed. Excluding boots and the jungle item, in most games you would aim to buy Sunfire Cape, Thornmail, and Warmog's Armor, and a single magic resistance item of your choice. If the enemy team was mostly attack damage type output, you would buy a duplicate of one of these first three items mentioned. And that's it. Nearly every game.<br>
					A common counter to this argument is picking a different champion in the draft. And that's a fair argument because that's an essential design element of the game. But the game can't reliably guarantee that every player has a well-mixed roster of champions to select from and perform evenly with all of them. This argument works with professional play, but that doesn't paint an accurate picture of an average game. You can never know which champions get picked, but you always know which <em>items</em> are available to you. Ultimately, and unfortunately, your item selection is determined by the champion selection before the game starts, whether you were a professional player or a casual gamer, because the meta dictates it.<br></p>
					<h4>My Solution</h4>
					<p>
						Simply put, any item can be built into any recipe. The idea is that basic tier items would provide the stat buffs and the recipes would provide the special effects, and that the player could decide what basic tier items they would use to craft those epic and legendary tier items. This would't change the special effects the items have, nor the stats those effects scaled off from, so for example Rabadon's Deathcap would still scale off from ability power even if it was built using attack damage. This would broaden the spectrum of item selection for all champions in the game. Here's how it works:</p>
					<h3>Zeldy's Item System</h3>
									<dl>
										<dt>Basic Tier</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>
												Basic tier items would provide a stat bonus exclusively; ability power, attack damage, attack speed, crit chance, health, health regen, mana, mana regen, armor, magic resist, cooldown reduction (yeah, it's <i>ability haste</i> now), and movement speed. There would be a low and high cost basic tier item of each stat (e.g. long sword is low cost and B. F. Sword is high cost). </p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Epic Tier</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>
												There would be two Epic tier item types:<br>
												<b>1)</b> an Epic item with a unique ability, which is built from one or more Basic tier items, which would provide stat bonuses depending on the Basic tier items used to build them, such as Phage, Bami's Cinder, Quicksilver Sash, or Oblivion Orb.<br>
												<b>2)</b> A combined Epic tier item, which is built from two or more Basic tier items and only provides the combined amount of stat bonuses depending on the Basic tier items used to build them, such as Fiendish Codex, Glacial Buckler, Aegis of the Legion, or Kindlegem.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Legendary Tier</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>
												Legendary tier items would still provide that capstone ability as they always have, except that in place of previously predetermined recipes, players could use any equivalent Epic and Basic tier items instead.<br>
												For example, if you needed a spell shield and played as an AD Carry, instead of making a Banshee's Veil with Fiendish Codex and Verdant Barrier, you could make it from Caulfield's Warhammer and Zeal, switching ability power and magic resistance to attack damage, attack speed, and crit chance, whilst keeping some of that cooldown reduction. </p>
										</dd>
									</dl>
					<h4>How Does It Work?</h4>
					<p>
						The core design idea is four-fold:<br>
						<b>1)</b> By building Legendary tier items with <b>cheaper</b> Basic tier items, players would get those unique abilities faster, such as Bloodthirster's <em>Blood Barrier</em> for an AD carry, Zhonya's Hourglass' <em>Stasis</em> for the AP carry, or Guardian Angel's <em>Rebirth</em> for anyone.<br>
						<b>2)</b> By building Legendary tier items with <b>any</b> Basic tier items, players would gain access to all Legendary tier item based unique abilities in the game, such as Zhonya's Hourglass for the AD carry, since they could build the item with Basic tier items that give attack damage instead of ability power, or Phantom Dancer for a tank, since they could build the item with Basic tier items that give armor, magic resistance, and health, instead of attack damage and attack speed.<br>
						<b>3)</b> By building <b>any</b> Epic tier items into your Legendary tier items, players would gain access to all Epic tier item based unique abilities in the game, such as building Quicksilver Sash into Phantom Dancer instead of Zeal, so they wouldn't be forced to build either Mercurial Scimitar or Silvermere Dawn to get the <em>Quicksilver</em> unique active ability in their item build.<br>
						<b>4)</b> All low cost Basic tier items can be later <b>upgraded</b> with their higher cost equivalent Basic tier items, such as Ruby Crystals with Giant's Belts, Long Swords with Pick Axes, and Amplifying Tomes with Blasting Wands. This would provide the players a choice of either going for the Legendary tier item's unique abilities, <b>or</b> building those base stats. This would also let players upgrade those items further than they used to.
					</p>
					<h4>Note Worthy</h4>
					<p>
						I know this would throw the current balance out of the window and create a wide range of new issues, absolutely it would. Everything in the game is currently built so that it supports the current version. But considering League of Legends is a game forever under progress, this doesn't seem like an issue to me. This level of change would obviously require an absurd amount of testing, but that's what the community is there for. I'm sure everything would settle down over time, and surely a whole new meta would usher in, creating a new slew of problems and rendering my meta hate moot. I'm just one person, and I don't have the resources make further calculations on the topic, but I feel my solution would provide players a wider selection playstyles and not tie them down to a specific item selection every time. I presented this to my friends around 2016/2017 so its been a long while, but I'm sad to see the game's Item System functions the same way it always has.</p>
