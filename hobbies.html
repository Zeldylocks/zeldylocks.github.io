					<h2>Super Mario Maker 2 for the Switch</h2>
					<p>Zeldylock's Super World Levels</p>

						The idea behind these levels is to create thematically consistent <a href="https://supermariomaker2.fandom.com/wiki/World_Maker">Super World</a>
						with 8 separate worlds inside. All levels are made in the Super Mario World
						<a href="https://supermariomaker2.fandom.com/wiki/World_Maker">game style</a> because of my personal preference,
						and to keep the game mechanics the same throughout the Super World. Each world has a different 
						<a href="https://supermariomaker2.fandom.com/wiki/Course_Themes">course theme</a>; first is Ground, second is Desert, etc.
						Most of my levels follow a repeating pattern (yes, very zeldaesque);
						<li><b>ENTER THE LEVEL</b></li> I do this to give the players more sense of agency. Even though they are the ones who boot the game
						and ultimately decide to play a level, I want to emphasize that feeling by giving the player that extra step of choice by often having them 
						enter a mandatory door or pipe at the start of a level. In short, the level doesn't start until the player decides so.
						<li><b>SOLVE THE PUZZLES</b></li> Most of my levels are a series of puzzles that need to be solved in order to progress. And not like a mechanical puzzle
						where you need to move blocks in certain way with a limited number of moves, but rather understanding the space around you and navigating through it.
						Essentially, forging a mental map and trying to remember what parts change upon interacting with your environment.
						<li><b>FIXATION ON PARALLEL</b></li> I love patterns and symmetrical design. And it will be extremely apparent in my level designs. Either the main area
						mirrors the sub area, or rooms or hubs have symmetrical designs. One way or another, visual repetition is a thing I do. But if the level doesn't seem
						to contain either, that means I've gone through great lengths to avoid it, or a gimmic I wanted to add totally prevented it.
						<li><b>WIN THE LEVEL</b></li> When the player solves my level, they are greeted with the same outro; upon reaching the goal, they're greeted with the same rewards
						and sound effects every time, uniting the levels as a collection of challenges for a more cohesive experience, and hopefully provide players with some
						extra sense of triumph!<br/><br/>
						These are things I like to repeat in my levels. Some level designs do not allow me to have all of these features. 
						Mainly the level intro and outro, since those are using the same pool of resources as the rest of the level.

					These PDFs were <b>practice for dramatic writing</b> and my <b>introduction to HTML</b>.<br>
					My Dungeon Master career started with the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons, and along with it came a whole new perspective to the game; <i>the narrative perspective</i>.
					And with this newly gained perspective, I found myself creating character designs out of thirst for drama. These characters are not optimized builds for <i>winning</i>
					in the game, but rather as intriguing character concepts I could make as possible. And after doing a few, I realized I wanted to make <i>one for each class</i>.<br>
					All characters contain a <b>Twist of Fate</b> as part of their backstory, which is a pivotal character arc moment the character has undergone, or will go later in the game, provided the Dungeon Master is up for it. 
					All characters are provided with a race, ability scores, a background, as well as spell, equipment, and subclass suggestions.
					All characters are <b>linked to each other</b> in the grand narrative. <br>
					You can <b>preview</b> the PDF below and <b>download</b> the PDF <a href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/print/1LZ3UflbHTtpaPNFsgAwuiE2cic1WppTpMwxXqzHsn9b5?dialog=true">here</a>. </p>

					When I was creating characters for my Tome of Characters, it wasn't my plan to make multiple tomes. But riding that train of inspiration is extremely fun and I started  getting ideas for more characters for classes I had already made a character for. And as those began to pile up, I started to realize that I'm going to make another tome.<br>
					Characters in this book follow the same parameters as the first tome, providing all the necessary information for someone to pick up one of these characters and play them in their D&D table. But as an additional rule for myself, I did not want to make duplicate subclass choices. Initially, I even tried avoiding using the same race twice as well, but I could not keep that rule. Some races are just too cool.<br>

				<h2>Heroes of Might and Magic® 3</h2>
				<p>Zelda Inspired Levels</p>
				</header>
				<div class="box alt">
				<p>
					Amongst a few other early PC games, Heroes 3 was one of my first segways to the game design and content creation world. It came with a map editor that allowed players to make their own custom maps and campaigns. Unfortunately, this happened back around the year 2000-2001, so only a few selected levels have survived the journey to this day. I have the original map files, but those are not compatible with the HD remake the company released on steam a few years ago. Luckily anyone with the original game can place these map files into their map folder and play the the levels. Contact me if you want those levels.<br><br>
					I made multiple maps back then, but they often followed a similar pattern; make a zelda game. I was, and still am, a huge zelda fan, and the old zelda formula will probably never leave me. Below are three levels that I made, all of which include a subterranean map world. Two of the levels use this parallel map as a space where the dungeons are, but because Ocarina of Time had a parallel adventure, the dungeons in this level are replaced with plain boss fights. Additionally, since the audio files of the game reside in a dedicated folder, I had provided a separate audio folder for my friends so that they could replace the original game audio files with zelda audio! <br><br>
					The three levels that survived are <b>Early Travels</b>, <b>Ocarina of Time</b>, and <b>the Wind Waker</b> levels, as presented below from left to right.

					<h2>League of Legends</h2>
					<p>Fixing the Item System</p>
				</header>
				<div class="box alt">
				<p>
					I started playing League of Legends in December 2010 and quit in December 2018, which means I've seen the majority of the development turns and twists the game has undergone over the years. Many aspects of the game went through major overhauls over the years, such as the map, the jungle, and nearly every single item and character individually, or as part of a bigger update. But one aspect would remain "unfinished" (in my opinion) to this day; the Items System.<br>
					Late 2020s, RIOT had an Item System Update, in which I took interest in even though I was no longer playing. It introduced new "Mythic" items for the late-game, revamped the Shop UI, and added a new recommendation system. As cool and broad as this update was, it unfortunately did not fix what I felt was broken; how the items work. The main grievance I have with their Item System, is the "meta" of which items are built. The items define how a champion is played, or the other way around, meaning when something is tweaked, it has a domino effect, brancing across other champions and items. And this cycle is hard to break, when a majority of the champions were designed around certain existing items, or as before, the other way around.My design attempts to shave off a large part of this item-champion co-dependency.</p>
					<h4>The Current Item System</h4>
					<p><i>Players purchase items from the shop. The item is a modular enhancement. The player's inventory can contain up to six main items, emphasizing selection importance. Most items can be improved. Improving an item increases its quality tier, which essentially are basic, epic, and legendary. Items above the basic tier have a recipe, which consists of a gold cost as well as a list of required lower tier items. Epic tier items require basic items, and legendary tier items require epic and/or basic tier items. The higher the tier, the bigger the buff, which basically are stat buff, passive effect, aura, and active effect. In conclusion, as the game progresses, the players buy increasingly expensive items as dictated by the legendary item recipes, which in turn are dictated by the champion they are playing with. This is called "the meta".</i></p>
					<h4>The Issue</h4>
					<p>My issue is the recipe-specific item exclusivity. Champions usually have a narrow pool of legendary items that synergize with them the best, and most of the time they center around one or two main stats most champions have, such as armor, magic resistance, health, mana, ability power, and attack damage (plus a few others). The selection can vary a little depending on your opponents and personal playstyle, but usually there is no room for meta deviations. And didn't like that. If you bought a basic tier item, you seemingly had a wide selection of items it could be built into, but ultimately always built the same items because there was actually only a certain legendary items that you could viably build. Worst of all, some scenarios forced you to buy duplicates of the same legendary items because it was your best choice. No matter how cool benefits other items would give, you couldn't build them because they would provide the <em>wrong basic stats</em>.<br>
					Example. If you played with Rammus, you would build as much armor and health as possible, because Rammus has a passive ability that synergizes with armor. This would mean you select to view every item in the shop that gave Health and Armor, and then buying those as the game progressed. However, excluding boots and the jungle item, nearly every game you would aim to buy Sunfire Cape, Thornmail, and Warmog's Armor, and a single magic resistance item of your choice. If the enemy team was mostly attack damage type output, you would buy a duplicate of one of these first three items I mentioned.<br>
					A common counter to this argument is picking a different champion in the draft. And that's a fair argument because that's an essential design element of the game. But the game can't reliably guarantee that every player has a well-mixed roster of champions to select from and perform evenly with all of them. This argument better serves the high-level professional play, but that doesn't paint an accurace picture of an average game. You can't know which champions get picked, but you ALWAYS know which items are available to you. Ultimately, and unfortunately, your items get determined by the champion selection before the game starts, whether you were a professional player or a casual gamer.<br></p>
					<h4>My Solution</h4>
					<p>Simply put, any item can be built into any recipe. The idea is that basic tier items would provide the stat buffs and the recipes would provide the special effects, and that the player could decide what basic tier items they would use to craft those epic and legendary tier items. This would't change the special effects the items have, nor the stats those effects scaled off from, so for example Rabadon's Deathcap would still scale off from ability power even if it was built using attack damage. This would broaden the spectrum of item selection for all champions in the game. Here's how it works:</p>
					<h3>Zeldy's Item System Tiers</h3>
									<dl>
										<dt>Basic Tier</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Basic tier items would provide a stat bonus exclusively; ability power, attack damage, attack speed, crit chance, health, health regen, mana, mana regen, armor, magic resist, cooldown reduction (yeah, it's <i>ability haste</i> now), and movement speed. There would be a low and high cost basic tier item of each stat (e.g. long sword is low cost and B. F. Sword is high cost). </p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Epic Tier</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>There would be two Epic tier item types:<br>
												<b>1)</b> an Epic item with a unique ability, which is built from one or more Basic tier items, which would provide stat bonuses depending on the Basic tier items used to build them, such as Phage, Bami's Cinder, Quicksilver Sash, or Oblivion Orb.<br>
												<b>2)</b> A combined Epic tier item, which is built from two or more Basic tier items and only provides the combined amount of stat bonuses depending on the Basic tier items used to build them, such as Fienish Codex, Glacial Buckler, Aegis of the Legion, or Kindlegem.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Legendary Tier</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Legendary tier items would still provide that capstone ability as they always have, except that in place of previously predetermined recipes, players could use any equivalent Epic and Basic tier items instead.<br>
												For example, if you needed a spell shield and played as an AD Carry, instead of making a Banshee's Veil with Fiendish Codex and Verdant Barrier, you could make it from Caulfield's Warhammer and Zeal, switching ability power and magic resistance to attack damage, attack speed, and crit chance, whislt keeping some of that cooldown reduction. </p>
										</dd>
									</dl>
					<h4>Note Worthy</h4>
					<p>I know this would throw multiple balance issues out of the window. But considering League of Legends is a game forever under progress, this doesn't seem like an issue to me. This kind of change would obviously require immense amount of testing and require absurd amount of testing. But that's what the community is there for. I'm sure everything would settle down over time, and who knows, perhaps a whole new meta would usher in, rendering my thought process here moot. I'm just one person, and I don't have the resources make further calculations on the topic. I presented this to my friends around 2016/2017, but I'm sad to see the game's Item System functions the same way it always has. </p>
