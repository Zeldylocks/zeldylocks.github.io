				<h2>Super Mario Maker 2 for the Switch</h2>

				<h3>Zeldylock's Super World</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm2/supermariomaker2banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<div class="box alt">
					<p>
						The idea behind these levels is to create thematically consistent <a href="https://supermariomaker2.fandom.com/wiki/World_Maker">Super World</a>
						with 8 separate worlds inside. All levels are made in the Super Mario World
						<a href="https://supermariomaker2.fandom.com/wiki/World_Maker">game style</a> because of my personal preference,
						and to keep the game mechanics the same throughout the Super World. Each world has a different 
						<a href="https://supermariomaker2.fandom.com/wiki/Course_Themes">course theme</a>; first is Ground, second is Desert, etc.
						Most of my levels follow a repeating pattern (yes, very zeldaesque);
						<li>ENTER THE LEVEL</li> I do this to give the players more sense of agency. Even though they are the ones who boot the game
						and ultimately decide to play a level, I want to emphasize that feeling by giving the player that extra step of choice by often having them 
						enter a mandatory door or pipe at the start of a level. In short, the level doesn't start until the player decides so.
						<li>SOLVE THE PUZZLES</li> Most of my levels are a series of puzzles that need to be solved in order to progress. And not like a mechanical puzzle
						where you need to move blocks in certain way with a limited number of moves, but rather understanding the space around you and navigating through it.
						Essentially, forging a mental map and trying to remember what parts change upon interacting with your environment.
						<li>FIXATION ON PARALLEL</li> I love patterns and symmetrical design. And it will be extremely apparent in my level designs. Either the main area
						mirrors the sub area, or rooms or hubs have symmetrical designs. One way or another, visual repetition is a thing I do. But if the level doesn't seem
						to contain either, that means I've gone through great lengths to avoid it, or a gimmic I wanted to add totally prevented it.
						<li>WIN THE LEVEL</li> When the player solves my level, they are greeted with the same outro; upon reaching the goal, they're greeted with the same rewards
						and sound effects every time, uniting the levels as a collection of challenges for a more cohesive experience, and hopefully provide players with some
						extra sense of triumph!<br/><br/>
						These are things I like to repeat in my levels. Some level designs do not allow me to have all of these features. 
						Mainly the level intro and outro, since those are using the same pool of resources as the rest of the level.

				<h2>Dungeons & Dragons</h2>
				<h3>Zeldylock's Character Catalogues</h3>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/j99VLUX.png" /></span>
					These PDFs were <b>practice for dramatic writing</b> and my <b>introduction to HTML</b>.<br>
					My Dungeon Master career started with the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons, and along with it came a whole new perspective to the game; <i>the narrative perspective</i>.
					And with this newly gained perspective, I found myself creating character designs out of thirst for drama. These characters are not optimized builds for <i>winning</i>
					in the game, but rather as intriguing character concepts I could make as possible. And after doing a few, I realized I wanted to make <i>one for each class</i>.<br>
					All characters contain a <b>Twist of Fate</b> as part of their backstory, which is a pivotal character arc moment the character has undergone, or will go later in the game, provided the Dungeon Master is up for it. 
					All characters are provided with a race, ability scores, a background, as well as spell, equipment, and subclass suggestions.
					All characters are <b>linked to each other</b> in the grand narrative. <br>
					You can <b>download</b> the PDF <a href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/print/1LZ3UflbHTtpaPNFsgAwuiE2cic1WppTpMwxXqzHsn9b5?dialog=true">here</a>, and <b>preview</b> the PDF <a href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/1LZ3UflbHTtpaPNFsgAwuiE2cic1WppTpMwxXqzHsn9b5">here</a>. </p>

					As I was creating characters for my Tome of Characters, it wasn't my plan to make multiple tomes. But riding that train of inspiration is extremely fun and I started to get ideas for more characters for classes I had already made a character for. And as those began to pile up, I started to realize that I'm going to make another tome.<br>
					Characters in this book follow the same parameters as the first tome, providing all the necessary information for someone to pick up one of these characters and play them in their D&D table. But as an additional rule for myself, I did not want to make duplicate subclass choices. Initially, I even tried avoiding using the same race twice as well, but I could not keep that rule. Some races are just too cool.<br>
					Unfortunately, <b>this PDF is not ready</b>, so I have not provided any links to it. Learning other skills started to take precedence.</p>
